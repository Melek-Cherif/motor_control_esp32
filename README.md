# ESP32 Servo Motor Control Project

This project was created to help get familiar with the ESP32 using the ESP-IDF framework. The main file runs an example that controls a servo motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). There is also an input from 4 IR sensors. Each sensor presents an angle for the motor movement.

## Project structure
- main/  Contains the main application code
- components/  Contains any additional components
- CMakeLists.txt  CMake build script
- sdkconfig  Configuration file for ESP-IDF

## Steps to Run the Code on ESP32 Using idf.py

1. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   idf.py build
2. **flash to target:**
   ```sh
   idf.py -p flash

## Dependencies
**ESP-IDF**: Ensure you have the ESP-IDF installed and set up on your machine. Follow the ESP-IDF getting started guide to install it.

## How It Works
**Servo Motor Control**: The servo motor is controlled using PWM signals generated by the ESP32.
**IR Sensors**: There are 4 IR sensors providing input to control the angle of the servo motor. Each sensor corresponds to a specific angle.
